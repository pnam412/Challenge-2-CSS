About Me 

* As a user I want to be able to create a website from scratch using html and css.

## Expected Behavior

I wanted to work on trying to layout a website using css flex-direction and float right. I inserted padding and margin for the container "About Me".

## Actual Behavior

I could use more practice and tutoring to better layout a website using CSS and HTML.  I have not yet been able to fully understand with codes to use.  I tried different codes to build the website and understand the ones I've used.  

## Assets

The following link for my website is available.
